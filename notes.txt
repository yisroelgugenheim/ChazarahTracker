Add toggle password visibility.

add links between admin panel and app only for admin.

admin panel sorely lacks proper layout and styling.

make it more personal by showing user a logged in icon in the top corner with their name, and adding their name in the post message as well.

issue: minutes tracker main container shifts up and down upon changing the height of the screen.

Needs explanation: 
Without an if statement, my function ran before accessing the id.
Wrapping my function in an if (id), made the code not run. 
However, adding an if (!id) return, before the function, made the code run after it got the id.

- Add posting message?

Why I'm only returning the current quarter's minutes:
- I'm (the user) posting minutes every week. 
- obviously, I'm supposed to be keeping track weekly. 
- The need for checking if under minutes/how many minutes under
  is a last resort in case user forgot. 
- So if I forget my minutes from a previous week, I shoud definitely check the quarter 
  minutes, and then I'll know how many minutes I'm under anyway.


- Fix error message in login!!!
